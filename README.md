# Exploring Wordplay and Misdirection in Cryptic Crossword Clues

University of Michigan MADS Capstone Project — SIADS 696, Winter 2026
Team: Victoria Winters, Sahana Sundar, Nathan Cantwell, Hans Li
Faculty Advisor: Dr. Kevyn Collins-Thompson

## Project Overview

This project applies natural language processing to cryptic crossword clues
(CCCs), a domain that poses unique challenges for language models due to
deliberate semantic misdirection and strict hidden grammatical structure.

The project has two independent components:

**1. Indicator Clustering** (`indicator_clustering/`)
Unsupervised clustering of 12,622 unique CCC indicator words and phrases to
explore whether their semantic embeddings naturally reflect the structure of
CCC wordplay types. Uses BGE-M3 embeddings with HDBSCAN and agglomerative
clustering.

**2. Clue Misdirection** (`clue_misdirection/`)
Supervised learning experiments quantifying how much the surface text of a
cryptic clue misleads embedding-based models attempting to predict the answer
from its definition.

## Data

The source data is George Ho's CCC dataset, available under the Open Database
License:

- Download: https://cryptics.georgeho.org/data.db
- The file will download as `data.sqlite3`
- Place it in `indicator_clustering/data/` before running any notebooks

## Running the Notebooks

Run notebooks in order. Each stage depends on outputs from the previous stage.

| Notebook | Environment | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 00_data_extraction_Victoria.ipynb | Local or Colab | Extract raw CSV files from data.sqlite3 |
| 01_data_cleaning_Victoria.ipynb | Local or Colab | Data cleaning and verification |
| 02_embedding_generation_Victoria.ipynb | Great Lakes or Colab (GPU) | BGE-M3 embedding generation |
| *(Stage 3 onwards)* | Great Lakes or Colab | Clustering and evaluation |

### Note on embedding generation

`02_embedding_generation_Victoria.ipynb` requires a GPU and the
`sentence-transformers` library. It is designed to run on the University of
Michigan Great Lakes cluster or on Google Colab with a GPU runtime enabled
(Runtime > Change runtime type > T4 GPU). The output file
`embeddings_bge_m3_all.npy` (shape 12,622 × 1024, ~49MB) is not included
in this repository due to size and must be generated by running this notebook.

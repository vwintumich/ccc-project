{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Prompt:** Is there a way to combine part of speech tagging with Sentence Transformers to make the transformer more aware of part of speech?"],"metadata":{"id":"pF90ygh9YLVU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Yes, there are several effective ways to combine Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging with Sentence Transformers.\n","\n","While Transformer models (like BERT or RoBERTa) learn a significant amount of syntax implicitly during pre-training, they are primarily optimized for semantic meaning. Explicitly injecting POS information can be highly beneficial for tasks that require **syntactic sensitivity** (e.g., grammar checking, stylometric analysis) or disambiguating complex sentences where word roles change the meaning entirely.\n","\n","Here are the three most effective strategies to achieve this, ranging from easy implementation to advanced architectural changes.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 1. Strategy: Syntax-Weighted Pooling (The Inference Approach)\n","\n","This is the most practical method for using existing Sentence Transformers without retraining them from scratch.\n","\n","Standard Sentence Transformers typically use **Mean Pooling**—they take the average of all token embeddings to create the sentence vector. This treats \"the\" (determiner) and \"system\" (noun) as equally important.\n","\n","You can modify this by using **POS-Weighted Pooling**. You assign higher weights to content words (Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives) and lower weights to function words (Determiners, Prepositions) before averaging.\n","\n","**How it works:**\n","\n","1. Run a fast POS tagger (like spaCy) on the input text.\n","2. Generate a weight vector based on the tags (e.g., Noun = 1.0, Det = 0.2).\n","3. Compute the weighted average of the transformer's token embeddings.\n","\n","### 2. Strategy: Input Augmentation (The Data Approach)\n","\n","This method modifies the text before it enters the model. You \"decorate\" the words with their POS tags so the model learns the association between the word and its role directly from the input string.\n","\n","There are two common formatting styles for this:\n","\n","* **Concatenation:** `The [DET] cat [NOUN] sat [VERB]`\n","* **Special Token Embedding:** `The_DET cat_NN sat_VB`\n","\n","**Pros:** No architectural changes needed; you just fine-tune the model on this new data format.\n","**Cons:** It increases the token count, making inference slower and reducing the maximum sequence length.\n","\n","### 3. Strategy: Feature Concatenation (The Architectural Approach)\n","\n","This is the most robust method but requires training a model structure modification.\n","\n","In standard BERT, a token's representation is the sum of three embeddings:\n","`Token Embedding` + `Position Embedding` + `Segment Embedding`.\n","\n","You can add a fourth layer: **`POS Embedding`**.\n","\n","1. Run the text through a POS tagger to get tag IDs.\n","2. Initialize a random embedding matrix for these tags (e.g., size ).\n","3. Sum this POS embedding with the standard token embedding before feeding it into the Transformer layers.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Implementation Example: Syntax-Weighted Pooling\n","\n","Here is a Python example of **Strategy 1**, as it allows you to inject POS awareness into *any* existing Sentence Transformer without retraining."],"metadata":{"id":"4b4N9cZdy9e9"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import torch\n","import spacy\n","from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\n","\n","# 1.

The preposition \"in\" has just as much voting power as the word \"accident.\"\n","\n","#### Scenario B: Syntax-Weighted Pooling\n","\n","We scale each vector by its importance before averaging.\n","\n","**The Result:** The \"noise\" is mathematically suppressed. The vector is dominated by the vectors for **Explorer**, **Termination**, **Boat**, and **Accident**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Step 3: The Semantic Impact\n","\n","How does this change the model's understanding?\n","\n","#### 1. Noise Reduction\n","\n","* **Standard:** The embedding might encode \"something happening *in* a location.\"\n","* **Syntax-Weighted:** The embedding aggressively encodes \"A **termination** event involving an **Explorer** and a **Boat Accident**.\" The preposition \"in\" is virtually ignored, preventing the model from retrieving irrelevant results just because they share the preposition \"in\".\n","\n","#### 2. Vector Rotation\n","\n","Imagine the vector space as a 3D map.\n","\n","* The word **\"in\"** points generally towards *generic locations*.\n","* The word **\"accident\"** points towards *disasters*.\n","\n","By down-weighting \"in\" from 1.0 to 0.1, you literally rotate the sentence vector away from the \"generic location\" cluster and deeper into the \"disaster/event\" cluster.\n","\n","#### 3. Why \"Termination\" matters here\n","\n","\"Termination\" is a noun here, but it implies an action. Standard models might lose the gravity of this word amidst the modifiers.

The distinguishing factors (\"termination\" and \"accident\") were indeed weighted high in Sentence A, but because Sentence B has *no* nouns to contradict them (only \"explorer\" and \"boat\"), the shared signal overwhelmed the difference.\n","\n","### The Fix: Penalizing Missing Information\n","\n","If your goal is to make the model realize that Sentence B is a *bad match* because it's missing the \"accident\" part, simply weighting nouns isn't enough if the distractor also has those nouns.\n","\n","You need to adjust the logic to **penalize the lack of semantic overlap** in the high-weight areas.
